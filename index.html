			<h1>BASKETBALL LIFE.</h1>
			<p>All I hear—
			the pounding sound of leather on wood,
			the smooth as silk swoosh of the ball
			going in the basket that drowns out the cheering crowd.
			THIS IS BASKETBALL.</p>
			<p>All I feel—
			the cold sweat pouring down my temples
			my bruises aching each time I run
			the force against my palms as I reject your shot.
			THIS IS BASKETBALL.</p>
			<p>All I see—
			the image frozen in my mind of the ball bouncing off the rim	
			my teammates faces as they cheer for me from the bench
			the end of the court seems a mile away.		
			THIS IS BASKETBALL.</p>
			<p>All basketball teaches me—
			to make a connection with others
			and if I work hard I can win
			win the game for my team.</p>
